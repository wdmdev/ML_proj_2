# ML_proj_2
A machine learning project from my course Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining on the third semester of my BSc Eng. in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at The Technical University of Denmark

The project focus was on evaluation and comparison of different classification and regression models.
Model accuracy was tested using 2-layer nested cross validation to reduce bias in the generalization errors of the models.

## Models used for classification
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decesion Tree
3. Baseline Model

## Models used for regression
1. Artificial Neural Network
2. Linear Regression
3. Baseline Model

Models were trained on data from http://noegletal.dk.
